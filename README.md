Aspiring Minds’ Employability Outcomes 2015 (AMEO 2015)

It is a unique dataset which contains engineering graduates’ employment outcomes (salaries, job titles and job locations) along with standardized assessment 
scores in three fundamental areas - cognitive skills, technical skills and personality.
Coupled with biodata information, AMEO 2015 provides an opportunity for a unique and comprehensive study of the entry level labor market. The data can be
used not only to make an accurate salary predictor, but also to understand what influences salary and job titles in the labor market.
